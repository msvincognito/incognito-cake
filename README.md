## Ingredients

For this jolly cake recipe you'll need:
- 280g solid, dry biscuits, violently dismembered
- 20g cocoa powder, dark as our souls
- 120g margarine, slowly and painfully molten
- 20g coffee beans, brutally grounded
- 150g icing / powdered sugar, acquired from your local dealer
- 200ml ice water, straight from the Third Circle of Hell
- A good mixer (very important for the cream!)

**Note**: margarine can be switched with butter if you dare make it non-vegan, ice water can be exchanged with refrigerated (soy) cream for an even creamier texture

## Ground:  

1. Add melted butter to the biscuits, as you stir the damp mixture, mix in ~~powdered void~~ cocoa powder
2. Force everything in a cake tin with a diameter of 26 cm and use a cup to press your victim tightly against it, leaving a border of maybe 1 cm that is also pressed against the sides. 
3. Put it in the fridge for 10 minutes and take it out right before it freezes to death.
4. Put it into the oven and torture your victim for 15 minutes by 180Â°C.

## Coffee Creme:

5. Add ground coffee beans, the icing sugar, and ice water into a bowl.
6. Mix relentlessly using mixer until it forgets its past self and becomes a smooth cream of conformity.
6. Now pour the creamy remains into the previously made cake ground so it fills the hole in its heart.
7. Put everything in the fridge for an hour.
8. Enjoy on your own ~~or at a party~~.

## Installation on Linux

Who realistically has time to manually build things? To speed it up, there's a Makefile supplied, so on UNIX
systems you can simply type `make`, as demonstrated below. If you're on Windows, refer to [these steps.](http://www.control-escape.com/linux/lx-install.html)

```
git clone https://github.com/msvincognito/incognito-cake
cd incognito-cake
make
```
